# UnitTests
In this post, I wanted to show that by knowing the concept of unit testing, we are able to make sure that our methods are designed in the correct way and that they deliver the intended results.

To this end, I designed nineteen unit tests for five simple methods derived from: **https://codingbat.com/java**.

# Running tests
