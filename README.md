# UnitTests
In this post, I wanted to show that by knowing the concept of unit testing, we are able to make sure that our methods are designed in the correct way and that they deliver the intended results.

To this end, I designed nineteen unit tests for five simple methods derived from: **https://codingbat.com/java**.

# Running tests
## Prerequisite
If you want to develop the application necessary will be
-	**java version 19.01 or later is required**,
-	**Apache Maven 3.8.6 or later**.

Please find below link to a tutorial on how to properly install:

## Launch process
Download the zip folder from the UnitTests repository with the project files.

Then save it to a specific location on your computer.                                                                 
On my computer, the project is located in:                                                                         
**C:\Users\Robert\IdeaProjects\UnitTests** 


Open the console by typing cmd at the command line.

In the next step type the following command in the console:                                                                    
**mvn clean test**


After typing the command, the unit tests should start in the console.
